Objective: Use qsort to sort arrays, and using function pointers
 
This is a lab where you will use qsort to sort an array of elements in
different ways.



Assignment
----------
In the provided sort.c file, edit it where necessary to sort the array
appropriately. Use qsort from stdlib.h to accomplish this.

To build the application and run it:

make
./sort

The second way you should sort the elements is alphabetically. You don't have
to write low level string comparison code to accomplish this because there's
already a function in string.h that can compare strings. It is reccommended
that you use that function in your implementation of this lab.
