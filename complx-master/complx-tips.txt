_("Remember that there is no differentiation between instructions and data.  If you look at the columns you can see your data being interpreted as instructions and your instructions being interpreted as plain old numbers.  The bits aren't important its what you choose to do with it that matters.  Remember this.")
_("Evil feature don't try this at home kiddies.  You can type instructions in the instruction column and have complx automagically assemble the instruction and place the data at that memory location.  I do not suggest writing your homeworks using this, but to use this as a tool to quick fix your code.")

_("Watchpoints are a useful debugging feature.  You can set a target to be watched for a certain condition ex. R0 == 25 and then when a write occurs to that target and the condition is true then a breakpoint will be triggered")
_("Press Ctrl+G and type an address (even expressions like PC+100 will work too) and the memory view will automatically scroll to that address")
_("Press Ctrl+V to get a new memory view.  This is useful for viewing addresses outside of your program (like the stack)")

_("If you mark a subroutine as a blackbox then you will never step into the subroutine.  If you are already in a subroutine and want to step out of it then hit the FInish button.  If you want to step over a subroutine call then use the Next Line button")
